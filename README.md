# Concentration-iOS

First simple iOS application attempt. Best run exclusively on the IPhone X simulator (as I learned autolayout after this :) )

Fully integrated APIXU for live weather data from any city! Check out different cities data by changing the string in the
viewDidLoad "getWeather" call for the ViewController!

Good tutorial (complete with explanitory comments) for querying and parsing data from public API's. Uses JSON Serializer
rather than the Decodable protocol.
